# Interview Scheduler

## Description

Create a simple app where admins can create interviews by selecting participants,
interview start time and end time

## Basic Requirements(All Completed)

1. An interview creation page where the admin can create an interview by selecting
   participants, start time and end time. Backend should throw error with proper
   error message if:

   a. Any of the participants is not available during the scheduled time (i.e, has
   another interview scheduled)
   b. No of participants is less than 2

2. An interviews list page where admin can see all the upcoming interviews.
3. An interview edit page where admin can edit the created interview with the same
   validations as on the creation page.
   Note: No need to add a page to create Users/Participants. Create them directly in the
   database

## Good to haves(2nd completed & 1st done using nodemailer but not working).

1. Send emails to participants on interview creation.
